# SuperFont
Allows creation and use of fonts made up of smaller ASCII characters
Default font is courier new.
The main user code is listed as USER.py
The main font creator code is listed as CREATE.py
To run either, the command "init_prog()" must be run. This can be run in either USER.py or CREATE.py and should only be run once, this will also wipe all previous fonts saved so only use this function when you are installing the program
Please ignore the folder beggining single_file_fonts... (or even delete this folder!!)
Downloadble fonts contain fonts which you can download. Please feel free to upload any fonts you've made to this!
